This file contains almost all sorting algorithms that are usually widely used.

1- Bubble sort algorithm
2- Insertion sort algorithm
3- Shell sort algorithm
4- Selection sort algorithm
5- Counting sort algorithm
6- Quick sort algorithm
7- Merge sort algorithm
8- Heap sort algorithm

- Every algorithm has been implemented to sort a simple python list (or array).
- Including time and space complexity for each one.
-  //  //  documentation & comments to get better understanding.
